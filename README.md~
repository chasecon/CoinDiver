Project description:

	Adding w,a,s,d commands to make a player movable, also adding painters algorithm and a hud


The easiest part of this project:
	
	overloading the functor to sort my vectors


Problems that I had in completing this project:

	Getting the sprite Prof. Malloy drew on the board and converting it into a working animated sprite. Finding out where to put the wasd commands was also tricky
