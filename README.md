Project description:

	Adding w,a,s,d commands to make a player movable, also adding painters algorithm and a hud


The easiest part of this project:
	
	overloading the functor to sort my vectors


Problems that I had in completing this project:

	Getting the sprite Prof. Malloy drew on the board and converting it into a working animated sprite. Finding out where to put the wasd commands was also tricky


Game/Level Design:
	My thoughts are to make this a falling coin game where you have to grab them as they fall. There will be torpedos going left and right as well as mines/depth charges falling from the sky that the player will have to dodge. The AI element will probably be an angler fish that follows the player around and if he gets to the player the player loses a life. There will be a menu where the player can choose his sprite and how many of certain enemies will spawn. There will also be levels where more enemies automatically spawn.
